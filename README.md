### Hi there 👋
I am a Lead Engineer at Samsung Ads, where I focus on developing real-time, high-scale, low-latency DSP (Demand Side Platform) bidder systems. I have a passion for building products, exploring and learning new technologies, and contributing to open source projects.

👐 Open for collaboration on projects
